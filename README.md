# Sports_Watch
Design project for my Intro to MicroProcessors course in which code for a sports watch with three different modes was implemented. 
Here is a link to a demonstration of its usage on a microcontroller and 7-segment displays: https://youtu.be/i59sRAOuh1g .
In the video I meant to say it had been running for 19 hours and 55 minutes, current time was 7:55 am.
